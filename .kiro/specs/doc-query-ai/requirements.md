# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DocQueryAI is a local chatbot application that enables users to upload PDF documents and query them using natural language. The system extracts text from PDFs, processes it into searchable chunks with embeddings, and uses a local LLM (Ollama with Phi-3 Mini) to provide context-aware answers. The application features a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction and uses Chroma as a local vector database for document storage and retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload PDF documents through a web interface, so that I can make them available for querying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a PDF file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is a valid PDF format
3. WHEN a valid PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content from all pages
4. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
5. IF the uploaded file is not a PDF THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically process uploaded PDFs into searchable chunks, so that I can query specific sections of the document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL split the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks
2. WHEN text is chunked THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for each chunk using Ollama's embedding models
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store the chunks and embeddings in the local Chroma vector database
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user that the document is ready for querying
5. IF processing fails at any step THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about uploaded documents in natural language, so that I can quickly find specific information without manually searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed and ready THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface for questions
2. WHEN a user enters a question THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search against the vector database
3. WHEN relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL retrieve the most contextually similar document sections
4. WHEN chunks are retrieved THEN the system SHALL pass them along with the user question to the Ollama LLM
5. WHEN the LLM generates a response THEN the system SHALL display the answer in the chat interface
6. IF no relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no relevant information was found

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my conversation history with the chatbot, so that I can reference previous questions and answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question and receives an answer THEN the system SHALL store the conversation in the chat history
2. WHEN the chat interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show previous questions and answers in chronological order
3. WHEN a new session starts THEN the system SHALL optionally load previous chat history from local storage
4. WHEN chat history becomes long THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling functionality to view older messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling and setup guidance, so that I can troubleshoot issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ollama is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message with setup instructions
2. WHEN any processing step fails THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL log the error details for debugging
