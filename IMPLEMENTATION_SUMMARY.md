- ✅ Module import verification
- ✅ Vector store initialization
- ✅ Chat engine initialization
- ✅ Text processing functionality
- **Result: 4/4 tests passed**

#### 2. End-to-End Workflow Tests (`test_end_to_end.py`)

- ✅ **Document Processing Pipeline**: PDF text extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and vector storage
- ✅ **Query Processing & RAG**: Complete RAG pipeline with document retrieval and LLM response generation
- ✅ **Chat History Management**: Session persistence and message history tracking
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and error scenarios
- **Result: 4/4 tests passed**

#### 3. Vector Store Fix

- **Issue Identified**: Vector store initialization issue in embedding pipeline
- **Solution Implemented**: Added automatic initialization in embedding pipeline with proper error handling
- **Verification**: Created targeted test to verify fix works correctly
